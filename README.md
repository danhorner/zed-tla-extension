# Zed TLA+ Extension
2024-09-01

I've been experimenting with the zed editor and learning to write TLA+
This trivial extension provides syntax highlighting by loading the tree sitter grammar.

I also added build tasks to my TLA project to run the model checker and Pluscal Translator in the terminal window.
Those are in the `tasks.json` file. You'll need to have a java and the TLA plus tools installed to use them
